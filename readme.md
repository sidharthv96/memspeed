# SpeedSync

Save video playback speeds for individual sites or Youtube channels.

Ever felt that some youtubers could go a bit faster?
But music channels should play at the default speed right?

Forget having to adjust speed of videos for every youtube channel.
Speedsync remembers the speed you have set for a particular website / Youtube Channel and automatically sets the speed for every video in that channel.
